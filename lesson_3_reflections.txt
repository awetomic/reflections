When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
to work from a different computer or collaborate with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Memory hog - better control, not having too many changes, etc.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A clone is a duplicate/copy of a repository, copied locally or remotely. A fork is similar to cloning except the file is hosted on GitHub, on their machine, copies can be monitored or linked to original.
Branches are copies, or versions of development within a repository.
